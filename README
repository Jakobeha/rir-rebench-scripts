HOWTO
=====

install rebench from https://github.com/charig/ReBench

copy default config

    cp rebench.conf.dist rebench.conf

setup paths to your rir and benchmark directory (LOCATION_RIR, LOCATION_AWF, LOCATION_SHT)

    vim rebench.conf

checkout master, compile a release build. then come back to this dir and:

    ./run.sh baseline.data

checkout your branch to test and compile

    ./run.sh feature.data

Now you can measure speedup of your featurebranch vs. baseline using:

    ./diff.rb feature.data baseline.data
